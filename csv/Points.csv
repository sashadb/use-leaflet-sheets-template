“This is the scour bridge now, The Travellers put the name on it and its the scour bridge now, there was a house back down there thats gone now that used to own that garden, That was a big wide road there was wagons trailers, and tents, that ditch was miles back.” Biddy Collins
<br><br>
“We’d get a tube, the tube out of a car, get a rope and tie the tube, put the tube across us go across that bridge throw across the rope and get someone to drags us back across the water. We’d pedal up and down that canal and we’d get the children to pedal up and down.” Bridgie Collins
<br><br>
""Dick and Paddy Dooley (Doon) they lived down here at scour bridge, the sister put the two of them out of the house and they bought a wagon and they had it for years and years.” James Collins

""That side of the road was all flat along and the wagons would park in longways with the forks facing up the way so when you light the fire you could sit in the mouth of the wagon or the tent and warm up. So each person had their tent or their wagon facing each other with the fire in between. The side of the road was completely flat theres hills there now, they did that in the 70's or 80's purposfully to stop the Travellers from pulling in.to camp, so this is how the block of cement for the bottom of the pump isint there, ya wont find it cause its covered."" Hughie Collins<br><br>""Theyd pull there cause of the wind and that, on both sides ya had the big ditch and it would block the wind from coming in on top of ya. What they used to do and I remember it very clearly, theyd watch for the farmer, there was a farmer down here I think it was the left or the right and he used to come that way and he used to carry the milk, me granny old Biddy would come out with a burner that they made of copper, the farmer would get out and the fresh milk hed pour it in and fill it for her. The freshest of milk."" Hughie Collins
<br><br>
""I remember bringing me father here 25 years ago and the pump was there and the base was there, then I was back me and my wife about 10 or 12 years ago the pump was gone but the base was there. <br><br>And believe it or not there was a way out to that field and I remember me grandfather he'd tie the horses feet with a piece of rag to stop em going anywhere, so no matter how long he left them they'd only be at the far side of the field. Spancil the pony they used to say. <br>The dump was up there Biddy up there on the left hand side, the local people would throw their rubbish and we used to go up and root for what ever we could find."" Hughie Collins ""We used to stop at this camp years ago and we used to call it The Pinkeen road, and it was a grand camp, it wasn't like it is now but it was real wide and we used put the tent in there, and the oul wagon and we hadn't a wagon and if you had a wagon at that time you were rich. It was a nice time and it was homely and the people was grand. You'd see an odd guard come down on the bike and he'd stop for a few minutes and go on again. They wouldn't bother ya that time they bother ya if ya put the oul pony out in a field and the farmer would get the guards and you'd have to leave, and that would only be a very odd time."" Biddy Collins <br><br>""The pump is gone the pump was there and the pump is gone, or someone took the pump that was where we used to get the water in the pump. We'll go in the name of the lord.""

""That house up there you would go to draw the milk, they'd give out the milk. There was four sisters living in there, they never got married, oh they were very very very nice, we'd get the milk there in the morning she'd tell ya ‚ come now when the cows are milked and you'll get milk', and she would give you a big yoke of dripping. There's two ways of going into that house one down there and you arrive at the back door and this would bring you to the front door, that would be for the gentry. <br><br>35 years since I was here, there was a little stream kind of a well down behind the bank and you'd get the spring water or even that you'd go back up there and there was a big pump on the right hand side. That time you'd love to stop along this road, we used to stay her for a month more or less, The men would be out bottoming the oul buckets and things and the women would be halking and trading, for food and things. There wouldn't be harm done to you. I stayed here with me family and then we got married and we stayed here and we'd walk back into Edenderry to go to the pictures""<br>Bridgie Collins
